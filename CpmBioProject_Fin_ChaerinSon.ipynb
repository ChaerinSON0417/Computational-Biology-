For this part, we will need the package `jsonlite`. **If the package should not be already installed,** check [here](https://anaconda.org/r/r-jsonlite) to find out how to install it using mamba (attention: we use mamba instead of conda) and your command line tool. Remember: Always first activate the correct environment, then install a new package. You might need to stop Jupyter notebook before installation and reopen it afterwards. To use the package in your notebook use the command `library(jsonlite)`. <br>\n",
